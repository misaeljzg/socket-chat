# WebServer + Socket Chat

This is an improvement built on top of my other WebServer with Node.js found in this account aswell, it implements socket.io with a simple chat which has a history function to show messages sent and also notify which clients are currently connected.

Remember to execute ```npm install ``` to rebuild the Node modules
